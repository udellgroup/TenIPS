# TenIPS: Inverse Propensity Sampling for Tensor Completion

This GitHub repository has the code for the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00323) [1] at AISTATS 2021. Please refer to the corresponding Jupyter notebook for each of the experiments. 

The video in the semi-synthetic experiment is available for download at <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HX6-motNPz_xZnkTJ32ZetRj_VUkI9XZ/view?usp=sharing>.

## Acknowledgments for experiments
The authors would like to thank <https://github.com/OsmanMalik/tucker-tensorsketch> for the video used in the semi-synthetic experiment, thank <https://github.com/georgehc/mnar_mc> for the code on 1-bit matrix completion and weighted soft-impute, and thank several StackOverflow posts for some helper functions.
